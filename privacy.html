                    is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or
                    warrant the complete security and privacy of your Personal Information or other content you transmit
                    using the Service, and you do so at your own risk. Thus, we encourage you to exercise discretion

                    absence of an EC Adequacy decision relevant to the destination country or to the transfer, seek to
                    rely on appropriate safeguards such as entering into appropriate EC approved standard contractual
                    clauses (see <a class="text-blue-500" target="_blank"
